# Cookbook 


Cookbook is a full-stack web app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete recipe blog posts. I built a RESTful API that serves data to a multi-page front-end styled with Sass and Bootstrap. The back-end utilizes custom slug URLs, and Django serializers, models, filters, and forms.
